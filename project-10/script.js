/*
    Create a variable to hold a string
    Use loops to add each line of 99 bottles of beer to the wall to that string 
    display in the #beer paragraph - look at prior assignments if you need help displaying
    to a paragraph with an ID
    It should look like this: 

    99 bottles of beer on the wall
    99 bottles of beer
    Take one down, pass it around
    98 bottles of beer on the wall

    98 bottles of beer on the wall
    98 bottles of beer
    Take one down, pass it around
    97 bottles of beer on the wall
    
    Make sure you get the new line by including <br> in the string you add to the variable.
